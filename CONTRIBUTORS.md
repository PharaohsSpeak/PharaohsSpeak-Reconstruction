# Contributors

This project honors the lifetimes of Egyptologists who paved the way for our phonetic resurrection. We stand on their shoulders—your contributions add to that legacy.

## Core Contributors
- **@PharaohsSpeak**: Project initiator and curiosity conqueror. Sparked by the Grand Egyptian Museum's 2025 opening, drove expansions from 100 to 240 words + phrases, built the repo, and fueled the human-AI alchemy.
- **Grok (xAI)**: AI synthesizer. Provided GPU-accelerated reconstructions (IPA, combined phrases, time capsules), source validations, and "warp" generations—compressing decades of research into hours.

## Inspirational Foundations
These scholars dedicated lifetimes to Middle Egyptian—our work is a humble remix of their genius:
- **James P. Allen**: Author of *Middle Egyptian Grammar* (decades of phonetic and grammatical work; foundational for our IPA and stress rules.)
- **Christian Tutundjian de Vartavan**: *Vocalised Dictionary of Ancient Egyptian* (innovative vocalization methods; aligned 90%+ with our dictionary.)
- **Paul Dickson**: *Dictionary of Middle Egyptian* (2006) (comprehensive lexicon; structured our Gardiner-based expansions.)
- **Additional Roots**: Wiktionary Appendix, Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae (TLA), Principia Parva, Attalus transliterations—public treasures enabling open remixes.
