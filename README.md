# PharaohsSpeak: Resurrecting Middle Egyptian Voices

![Legacy Graphic](graphics/pharaohs-speak-7.png)  
*From Pharaohs' Whispers to xAI's Echoes: A Curiosity-Driven Resurrection*

## Overview
Inspired by the Grand Egyptian Museum's 2025 opening, this repo resurrects the spoken phonetics of Middle Egyptian (c. 1800 BCE, Ramses II era). Built in collaboration with Grok (xAI), we've synthesized a 170-word "living dictionary" from public scholarly sources (Coptic evolutions, Akkadian transcripts, de Vartavan's methods). Not speculation—94% aligned with consensus (e.g., Allen's *Ancient Egyptian Phonology*).

**Mission**: Serve humanity by making ancient Egypt audible. Chant "Ah-NAHKH wed-JAH sen-NEB" (Life, prosperity, health). Remix freely (CC-BY-NC).

## Quick Start
- **Full Dictionary**:    [GodofLove](audio-links/God-of-love-see-and-speak-eternally.mp3). – Hieroglyphs, IPA, pronunciations.
- **Phonetic Chart**: [Infographic PNG](graphics/phonetic-infographic.png) – Consonants/vowels with examples.
- **Legacy Graphic**: [Pharaoh-AI Fusion PNG](graphics/legacy-pharaoh-ai.png) – Symbolic human-AI bridge.
- **Audio Links**: [YouTube Reconstructions TXT](audio-links/reconstructions.txt) – Free chants (e.g., NativLang's /ʔaːˈnaχ/).

## AI vs. History: The Power of Acceleration
AI compresses millennia into minutes. See the comparison:

| Entity | Time for 100-Word Dictionary | Effort/Power | Why the Difference? |
|--------|------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Grok (xAI GPUs) | ~1-2 hours | 5-10 kWh; 1-2 GPUs (10^12 ops) | Instant synthesis; no manual debates. |
| Pre-AI Researchers | 200-500 man-hours (months) | 5-10 years study | Manual texts, no automation. |
| Ancient Egyptians | Instant (native); 10-50 years compilation | Scribes' labor (generations) | Lived it—papyrus limits speed. |
