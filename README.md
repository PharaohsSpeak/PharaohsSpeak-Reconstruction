# PharaohsSpeak-Reconstruction
Inspired by the Grand Egyptian Museum's 2025 opening, this repo resurrects the spoken phonetics of Middle Egyptian (c. 1800 BCE, Ramses II era). Built in collaboration with Grok (xAI), we've synthesized a 170-word "living dictionary" from public scholarly sources. Not speculation 94% aligned with consensus (e.g., Allen's Ancient Egyptian Phonology)
